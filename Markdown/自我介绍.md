Good morning! Dear professors!

I feel so glad to meet all of you here. My name is WangYizhen,23 years old, born in Shaanxi, Xian. I was studied in XIDIAN University, majored in electronic science and technology.

During my college period, I won the school's second-class scholarship. Moreover, I joined the computer department of our school and participated in the Aster project. As a member of the project, we work together and won the silver prize of the Internet plus school competition. I also served as the Minister of Science and Technology Association of our college, organizing publicity work, Assisting with project selection, and docking with school. 

The reason I choose XIDIAN University is that my old school is also XIDIAN University, there is so many feelings and memories in this place. I think it’s a wise choice to choose electronic science and technology because this major overlaps with my undergraduate major, so it's easier to enter the daily study life. This major also has a lot of academic resources and high-level academic conferences as I know, these are the things I look forward to.

If I’m lucky to be admitted by XIDIAN University, I will work hard and take the initiative to participate in the academic research of our team, and be a useful person. This is all my self-introduction, thank you for listening.
